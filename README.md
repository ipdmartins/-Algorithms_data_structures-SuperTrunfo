	This repo is about university work, more specifically on the subject of Algorithms and Data Structures. The aim was to implement a card game called Super-Trunfo. This game, commonly, has two players with a stack of cards each. Every card has technical information about a subject that might be about a car, a helicopter, a boat, a bicycle, or anything else. So, these players choose one characteristic of their card to compete. If their opponent has a stronger number the better lose his card. The objective is to take all the cards from the opponent.

	The subject proposes the study of certain algorithms, especially some that aim to solve complex problems, like the best route from one point to another. Data structures, in general, is the study of how to organize data and data location in software. Some examples of such organization may be represented by arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, graphs, trees, and more.
